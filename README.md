# coredns-ens

CoreDNS-ENS is a CoreDNS plugin that resolves DNS information over ENS.  It has two primary purposes:

  1. A general-purpose DNS resolver for DNS records stored on the Ethereum blockchain
  2. A specialised resolver for IPFS content hashes and gatways

Details of the first feature can be found at http://www.wealdtech.com/articles/ethdns-an-ethereum-backend-for-the-domain-name-system/

The second feature provides a mechanism to map DNS domains to ENS domains by removing the relevant suffix, for example the DNS domain `wealdtech.eth.link` maps to the ENS domain `wealdtech.eth`, and returning information for IPFS gateways (if an A or AAAA record is requested) as well as IPFS and content hashes (if a TXT record is requested).  The result of this is that IPFS content can be obtained from any web browser by simply 

# Building

As coredns-ens is a CoreDNS plugin it requires integration in to the CoreDNS source code and a rebuild of the CoreDNS binary.  If a manual installation is required, for example if the platform on which this is being built is not supported by the script or the user wants to use multiple plugins, details can be found at https://coredns.io/2017/07/25/compile-time-enabling-or-disabling-plugins/

There is a build script that generates the `coredns` binary with the ENS plugin.  It should work on most unix-like systems and can be run with:

    ./build.sh

If a Docker image is required as well this can be carried out by the build process by adding a group parameter to the build script, for example:

    ./build.sh wealdtech

would build the docker image `wealdtech/coredns`.

# Corefile

The plugin has a number of configuration options.  An example annotated Corefile is shown below:

```
# This section enables DNS lookups for the eth.link domain.
eth.link {
  ens {
    # connection is the connection to an Ethereum node.  It is *highly*
    # recommended that a local node is used, as remote connections can
    # cause DNS requests to time out.
    # This can be either a path to an IPC socket or a URL to a JSON-RPC
    # endpoint.
    connection /home/ethereum/.ethereum/geth.ipc
    # ipfsgatewaya is the address of an ENS-enabled IPFS gateway.
    # This value is returned when a request for an A record is received
    # and the domain has a contenthash record in ENS but no A record.
    # Multiple values can be supplied, separated by a space, in which case
    # all records will be returned.
    ipfsgatewaya 176.9.154.81
    # ipfsgatewayaaaa is the address of an ENS-enabled IPFS gateway.
    # This value is returned when a request for an AAAA record is received
    # and the domain has a contenthash record in ENS but no A record.
    # Multiple values can be supplied, separated by a space, in which case
    # all records will be returned.
    ipfsgatewayaaaa 2a01:4f8:160:4069::2
  }
  errors
  log
}
# This section enables DNS over TLS.  It should be a copy of the above
# configuration, with the addition of a TLS line to supply the TLS 
# certificate.
tls://eth.link {
  tls /etc/coredns/security/fullchain.pem /etc/coredns/security/privkey.pem /etc/coredns/security/chain.pem
  ens {
    connection /home/ethereum/.ethereum/geth.ipc
    ipfsgatewaya 176.9.154.81
    ipfsgatewayaaaa 2a01:4f8:160:4069::2
  }
  errors
  log
}
# This section enables DNS over HTTPS.  It should be a copy of the TLS
# configuration.
https://eth.link {
  tls /etc/coredns/security/fullchain.pem /etc/coredns/security/privkey.pem /etc/coredns/security/chain.pem
  ens {
    connection /home/ethereum/.ethereum/geth.ipc
    ipfsgatewaya 176.9.154.81
    ipfsgatewayaaaa 2a01:4f8:160:4069::2
  }
  errors
  log
}
# This enables DNS forwarding.  It should only be enabled if this DNS server
# is not exposed to the internet, otherwise it becomes an open DNS server and
# will be flooded with attack packets.
#. {
#    forward . 8.8.8.8
#}
```

Note that the TLS and HTTPS configurations require a certificate to operate securely.  Certificates can be generated by LetsEncrypt or some other provider.

# Running standalone

Running CoreDNS standalone is simply a case of starting the binary.  See the CoreDNS documentation for further information.

# Running with Docker

Running CoreDNS with Docker requires running the image created in the `Building` section.  A sample command-line might be:

    docker run -p 53:53/udp -p 853:853 -p 443:443 --volume=/home/coredns:/etc/coredns wealdtech/coredns:latest

where `/home/coredns` is the directory on the server that contains the Corefile and certificates.
